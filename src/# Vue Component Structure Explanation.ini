# Vue Component Structure Explanation

This document explains the structure and interaction of Vue components in our project.

## Main Components

1. **SummaryForm.vue**:
   - This is the main component that acts as the container for other forms.
   - Depending on the selected condition, it dynamically includes different sub-components.

2. **Sub-Components**:
   - `MVDForm.vue`: This form is used for Microvascular Decompression (MVD) procedures. It is further categorized into:
     - `TN` (Trigeminal Neuralgia)
     - `HFS` (Hemifacial Spasm)
   - `StrokeForm.vue`: This form is used for stroke-related procedures and patient information.
   - `AsymptomForm.vue`: This form is used for asymptomatic cases or screenings.

## Component Interaction

- **SummaryForm.vue**:
  - This component dynamically includes one of the sub-components (`MVDForm`, `StrokeForm`, or `AsymptomForm`) based on the selected disease.
  - The sub-component inclusion is managed using conditional rendering with Vue's `v-if` directive.
